**Hotel Aggregator Analysis Project**

*Overview*

This internship project focuses on analyzing a dataset of hotel aggregator listings using Power BI. The dataset includes various attributes related to listings, hosts, reviews, and availability. The primary goal is to create comprehensive visualizations and insights that reveal trends, patterns, and factors influencing the performance of listings. By leveraging Power BI, we aim to explore key metrics such as pricing, availability, host characteristics, and review scores to derive actionable insights for enhancing the overall quality and competitiveness of the listings.


**Dataset Description**

The dataset consists of numerous columns capturing detailed information about listings, including:


id: Unique identifier for each listing.
listing_url: URL of the listing on the hotel aggregator platform.
scrape_id: Identifier for the data scraping event.
last_scraped: Date of the last data scrape.
source: Source of the listing information.
name: Name of the listing.
description: Description of the listing.
neighborhood_overview: Overview of the neighborhood where the listing is located.
picture_url: URL of the listing's picture.
host_id: Unique identifier for the host.
... (and many more columns detailing hosts, location, property type, room details, amenities, pricing, availability, reviews, and other relevant information).


**Project Objectives**

_1. Geographical Insights_
Visualize the distribution of listings on a map to identify popular neighborhoods.
Explore the geographical concentration of listings and host locations.

_2. Pricing and Availability Analysis_
Analyze pricing trends based on property types, room types, and accommodation capacity.
Investigate the availability of listings over time and identify peak periods.

_3. Host Performance_
